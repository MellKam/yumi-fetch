 * This function creates shorthand methods for making fetch calls with specific HTTP methods.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { clientCore, httpMethods } from "yumi-fetch";
 *
 * const client = clientCore.withProperties(httpMethods());
 *
 * // BEFORE ðŸ˜•
 * client.fetch("/todos", { method: "POST" })
 * // AFTER ðŸ˜ƒ
 * client.post("/todos")
 * ```
 *
 * By default it provides limited set of http methods `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` but you can also provide your own set as the array of strings.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const client = clientCore.withProperties(
 * 	 httpMethods(['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'OPTIONS', 'HEAD', 'TRACE'])
 * )
 *
 * client.options("/api/user")
 * client.head("/api/user")
 * client.trace("/api/user")
 * ```
 *
 * _This methods are included in the yumi client by default_
